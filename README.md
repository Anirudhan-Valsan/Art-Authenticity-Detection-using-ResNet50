🔍 The AI Art Detective: How I Built a Deep Learning System to Spot Machine-Created Art (During My Luminar Technolab Internship)

The art world is facing its biggest revolution since the camera - AI-generated artwork. But how can we tell what's human-made anymore? I built the solution:


🖼️ Presenting my Art Authenticity Detector - an AI system that spots machine-generated art with 83% accuracy

⚙️ Technical Deep Dive:

- Engineered a hybrid ResNet50 architecture combining:

  - Transfer learning from ImageNet

  - Custom dense layers fine-tuned on 60k+ artworks

  - Developed a robust preprocessing pipeline with:

  - Smart image augmentation (20° rotations, 20% zooms, flips)

  - Automated dataset organization

  - Built an interactive Flask web interface featuring:

  - Real-time analysis

  - Visual confidence metrics

  - Interpretable explanations


🎯 Real-World Impact:

This isn't just another classifier - it's solving actual problems:

→ Helping artists protect their original works

→ Enabling galleries to maintain collection integrity

→ Giving collectors confidence in their purchases

→ Preserving academic honesty in art schools


📈 Performance Highlights:

- 83% validation accuracy

- Optimized inference speed (<3s per image)

Fun Fact: My model occasionally gets tripped up by hyper-realistic digital paintings as well as exceptional AI images, mistaking them for AI or human art. It’s not perfect and has some errors, but it’s a promising starting point for distinguishing between AI-generated and human-created artwork!


💭 Food for Thought:

As AI art generators improve exponentially:

- Should there be mandatory disclosure of AI use?

- How do we preserve the value of human creativity?

- Where should we draw the line between tool and artist?
